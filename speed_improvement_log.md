**User**

Can you analyze my project and suggest ways to improve runtime, as it is really slow on vercel

---

**Cursor**

I'll help analyze your project for performance improvements. Let me first check some key files to understand the project structure and potential bottlenecks.

First, let me look at your package.json to understand the dependencies and project setup:

Let me also check your Vite configuration:

Let me check your source directory structure:

Based on my analysis, here are several recommendations to improve your project's runtime performance on Vercel:

1. **Optimize Dependencies:**
   - You're using some heavy dependencies like `@splinetool/react-spline` and `framer-motion` which can impact initial load time
   - Consider lazy loading these components using React.lazy() and Suspense where they're not needed immediately

2. **Bundle Size Optimization:**
   - Add build-time code splitting by implementing dynamic imports for routes
   - Your Vite config can be optimized. Here's what I'll add:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          'vendor': ['react', 'react-dom'],
          'animations': ['framer-motion'],
          'spline': ['@splinetool/react-spline']
        }
      }
    },
    chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
    minify: 'terser',
    terserOptions: {
      compress: {
        drop_console: true,
        drop_debugger: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

3. **Image Optimization:**
   - Add a `vercel.json` configuration to enable image optimization:

```json
{
  "images": {
    "sizes": [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200],
    "domains": ["localhost"],
    "minimumCacheTTL": 60
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*).(js|css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|svg)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **React Optimizations:**
   Let me check your main App component to suggest specific optimizations:

Here are additional React-specific optimizations:

5. **Preloader Optimization:**
   - Your preloader shows for a fixed 4 seconds, which might be unnecessary. Let's modify it to load based on actual content readiness:

```javascriptreact
import { useState, useEffect, lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Preloader from './components/Preloader';
import { Toaster } from './components/ui/toaster';

// Lazy load components
const Home = lazy(() => import('./components/Home'));
const NotFound = lazy(() => import('./components/NotFound'));

function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the window has finished loading
    if (document.readyState === 'complete') {
      setIsLoading(false);
    } else {
      window.addEventListener('load', () => setIsLoading(false));
      return () => window.removeEventListener('load', () => setIsLoading(false));
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <Toaster />
      {isLoading ? (
        <Preloader />
      ) : (
        <BrowserRouter>
          <Suspense fallback={<Preloader />}>
            <Routes>
              <Route index element={<Home />} />
              <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
            </Routes>
          </Suspense>
        </BrowserRouter>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

Here's a summary of all the optimizations I've implemented:

1. **Build Optimization:**
   - Added chunk splitting in Vite config to separate vendor code
   - Implemented Terser minification with console removal
   - Increased chunk size warning limit

2. **Caching and Image Optimization:**
   - Added Vercel image optimization configuration
   - Implemented aggressive caching for static assets
   - Added proper cache headers for all static resources

3. **React Performance:**
   - Implemented lazy loading for route components
   - Added Suspense boundaries for better loading states
   - Optimized the preloader to use actual page load state instead of a fixed timer

Additional recommendations for further optimization:

1. **Consider implementing:**
   - Use `react-query` or `SWR` for data fetching if you're fetching data
   - Implement proper memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive computations
   - Use the `@vercel/speed-insights` package you already have installed to monitor performance

2. **Asset Optimization:**
   - Compress and optimize images in your `assets` directory
   - Consider using WebP format for images with PNG/JPEG fallbacks
   - Use SVGs where possible for icons and simple graphics

3. **Code Splitting:**
   - Consider splitting your CSS into critical and non-critical paths
   - Implement route-based code splitting for larger sections of your app

Would you like me to implement any of these additional optimizations or would you like to see the performance impact of the current changes first?

**User**

on vercel, it says largest contentful paint is 6.62 secs

---

**Cursor**

The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of 6.62 seconds is quite high - Google recommends keeping it under 2.5 seconds for a good user experience. Let me help optimize this specifically.

First, let me check your Home component since it's likely the main source of the LCP:

Let me check the Hero component since it's likely the first large contentful paint element:

I can see several issues that are likely contributing to the high LCP:

1. The Spline 3D scene is loading immediately and blocking the main content
2. There's no loading optimization for the 3D model
3. The animations are delaying content visibility

Let's make several optimizations:

1. First, let's optimize the Hero component:

```javascriptreact
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { lazy, Suspense, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Lazy load Spline
const Spline = lazy(() => import('@splinetool/react-spline'));

const Hero = () => {
  const [isSplineLoaded, setIsSplineLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [shouldLoadSpline, setShouldLoadSpline] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Delay loading Spline until after main content is visible
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setShouldLoadSpline(true), 100);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <section
      id="Hero"
      className="relative h-screen w-full bg-black bg-gradient-to-b from-red-700 to-black overflow-hidden"
    >
      {/* Spline background */}
      {shouldLoadSpline && (
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: isSplineLoaded ? 1 : 0 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
          className="absolute inset-0 z-0"
        >
          <Suspense fallback={null}>
            <Spline 
              scene="/destiny.spline" 
              onLoad={() => setIsSplineLoaded(true)}
            />
          </Suspense>
        </motion.div>
      )}

      {/* Text content */}
      <div className="relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full px-4 text-center">
        <motion.h1
          initial={{ y: 20, opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
          transition={{
            type: 'spring',
            stiffness: 50,
            damping: 20,
            duration: 0.5
          }}
          className="text-[2.5rem] sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-primary-foreground"
        >
          <span className="block">
            Varun <span className="text-primary">Parekh</span>
          </span>
          <span className="block mt-2">
            Beyond <span className="text-primary">Innovation</span>
          </span>
        </motion.h1>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Hero;
```

2. Let's optimize the main content loading in Home.jsx:

```javascriptreact
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import Navabar from "./Navabar";
import Hero from "./Hero";

// Lazy load non-critical components
const Contact = lazy(() => import("./Contact"));
const Skills = lazy(() => import("./Skills"));
const Projects = lazy(() => import("./projects"));
const Experience = lazy(() => import("./Experience"));
const Aboutme = lazy(() => import("./Aboutme"));
const Footer = lazy(() => import("./Footer"));

// Loading fallback
const LoadingSection = () => (
  <div className="w-full h-[50vh] flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="animate-pulse bg-primary/10 rounded-lg w-full max-w-4xl h-full mx-4" />
  </div>
);

const Home = () => {
    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen bg-background text-foreground overflow-x-hidden">
            <Navabar/>

            {/*content*/}
            <main>
                <Hero/>
                <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSection />}>
                    <Aboutme/>
                    <Skills/>
                    <Experience/>
                    <Projects/>
                    <Contact/>
                </Suspense>
            </main>
            
            {/*footing*/}
            <Suspense fallback={null}>
                <Footer/>
            </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Home;
```

3. Let's also preload the 3D model. Create a new file for preloading assets:

```javascript
export const preloadSplineScene = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const link = document.createElement('link');
        link.rel = 'preload';
        link.as = 'fetch';
        link.href = '/destiny.spline';
        link.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
        link.onload = resolve;
        document.head.appendChild(link);
    });
};

export const preloadAssets = async () => {
    await preloadSplineScene();
};
```

4. Let's update the main entry point to start preloading:

```javascriptreact
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'
import { preloadAssets } from './libs/preload.js'

// Start preloading assets immediately
preloadAssets();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

These optimizations should significantly improve your LCP time. Here's what we've done:

1. **Optimized Hero Component:**
   - Lazy loaded the Spline 3D scene
   - Delayed loading of the 3D scene until after initial content render
   - Added proper loading states and transitions
   - Reduced initial animation delays

2. **Optimized Main Content Loading:**
   - Lazy loaded all non-critical components
   - Added loading fallbacks with skeleton UI
   - Kept only the navbar and hero section in the critical path

3. **Added Asset Preloading:**
   - Created a preload system for the 3D scene
   - Started preloading as soon as the app loads
   - Added proper resource hints

4. **Reduced Initial Bundle Size:**
   - Split non-critical components into separate chunks
   - Deferred loading of heavy components
   - Improved the loading sequence

To further improve LCP, you might want to:

1. Consider using a static image as a placeholder while the 3D scene loads
2. Compress the 3D model file if possible
3. Consider using a CDN for serving the 3D model file
4. Monitor the performance using Vercel Speed Insights to identify any remaining bottlenecks

Would you like me to implement any of these additional optimizations? Also, after deploying these changes, please share the new LCP time so we can see if further optimizations are needed.
